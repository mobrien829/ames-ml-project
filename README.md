# ames-ml-project

By: Joaquin Gomez, Tam Trinh, Caroline Keough, Michael O'Brien


In this project, our group took on the role of data scientists at Zillow, to come up with "Zestimate" values of homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset came with 2580 observations and 81 columns of features about the homes. We used this information to perform EDA and modeling. We then split our data with train-test split and received an R^2 value of over 0.93 for our test score.
